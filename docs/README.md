## Features:
   
### **One Bed Sleeping** 

This mod can cause a vast amount of saturation to be consumed during play. 
Every 0.2 to this value is one small bar of hunger lost over a seven hour sleeping period. 
Sleeping in a straw bed usually drops a player's saturation by five bars. 
At the moment, I haven't added a sleep-voting system, because of the logic involved in making such a system. 
As this mod evolves, I may be able to add something like that in, as a separate feature. 

## Server-Side Commands:

| Command							| Description |
| ---								| --- |
| **/obs hunger (0.0 -> 2.0)**		| Change the rate at which saturation is lost while sleeping. Default : 1.0 |
| **/obs players (0.0 -> 100.0)**	| The percentage of players online that need to sleep, before time passes. Minimum of one person. Default: 0.0 |
